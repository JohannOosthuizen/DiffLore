## FileTree Documentation

**Overview:**

The `FileTree` class provides a graphical file browsing interface using Tkinter for selecting files within a specified directory. It displays the directory structure as a treeview and allows users to select files, triggering a callback function (`on_file_select`) with the selected file's path. This component is likely part of a larger application where user interaction is required to choose files from a local filesystem (e.g., a markdown editor or document viewer).

**Key Components:**

*   **`FileTree(parent, on_file_select)`**:
    *   **Inputs:** `parent` (Tkinter parent widget), `on_file_select` (callback function taking file path as argument).
    *   **Outputs:** None. Creates and initializes a Tkinter Treeview widget representing the directory structure.
    *   **Logic:** Initializes the treeview, binds the selection event to `on_tree_select`, and stores the callback function for file selection handling.

*   **`populate_tree(directory)`**:
    *   **Inputs:** `directory` (string: path to the root directory).
    *   **Outputs:** None. Populates the treeview with files and subdirectories of the specified directory.
    *   **Logic:** Clears existing tree entries, sets the current directory, and calls `process_directory` to recursively build the tree structure.

*   **`process_directory(parent, path)`**:
    *   **Inputs:** `parent` (string: parent item ID in the treeview), `path` (string: absolute file system path).
    *   **Outputs:** None. Recursively adds files and directories to the treeview.
    *   **Logic:** Iterates through items within a directory, adding them as nodes if they are markdown files or subdirectories.  Recursively calls itself for each subdirectory found.

*   **`on_tree_select(event)`**:
    *   **Inputs:** `event` (Tkinter event object).
    *   **Outputs:** None. Calls the provided `on_file_select` callback function when an item is selected in the treeview.
    *   **Logic:**  Retrieves the selected item's ID, constructs the full file path using `get_full_path`, and calls `on_file_select` with that path if it represents a file.

*   **`get_full_path(item)`**:
    *   **Inputs:** `item` (string: treeview item ID).
    *   **Outputs:** String: Absolute file system path of the selected item.
    *   **Logic:** Traverses up the tree hierarchy to reconstruct the full path based on the item's text labels and the initial directory.

**Dependencies:**

*   `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system (listing files, checking if a path is a file or directory).  Version unspecified – relies on standard library.
*   `tkinter`: Provides the GUI framework. Version unspecified – relies on standard library.
*   `tkinter.ttk`: Provides themed Tkinter widgets like `Treeview`. Version unspecified – relies on standard library.
*   **Internal:** Assumes the existence of an `on_file_select` callback function passed during initialization.

**Edge Cases:**

*   **Permission Errors:**  If the program lacks permissions to access a directory, `os.listdir()` will raise an exception. Error handling (e.g., try-except blocks) is not implemented in this code snippet.
*   **Circular Directory References:** Recursive calls within `process_directory` could lead to infinite loops if circular symbolic links exist. This isn't explicitly handled.
*   **Large Directories:** Populating a treeview with a very large number of files can be slow and unresponsive.  Consider implementing pagination or lazy loading for performance in such scenarios.
*   **Non-ASCII File Names:**  The code assumes ASCII file names; non-ASCII characters might cause issues depending on the operating system's encoding.

**Rationale:**

The recursive approach using `process_directory` is a common and straightforward way to build tree structures from directory listings. The use of `ttk.Treeview` provides a visually appealing and standard Tkinter widget for file browsing.  Alternatives like custom drawing or different tree data structures were not considered in this implementation due to the simplicity requirement.
