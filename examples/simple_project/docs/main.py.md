# Web Research Script Documentation

## Overview

This script performs a simple web research task: fetching the title of a webpage. It's designed as a basic example and could be expanded to scrape data from multiple pages or perform more complex analysis. Currently, it directly fetches Google's homepage and prints its title.  It serves as a rudimentary illustration of web scraping using Python.

## Key Components

* **`main()` function:**
    * **Input:** None (hardcoded URL).
    * **Output:** Prints the webpage title to standard output.
    * **Logic:**
        1. Defines the target URL (`https://www.google.com`).
        2. Uses `requests.get(url)` to retrieve the HTML content of the specified URL.
        3. Creates a `BeautifulSoup` object from the response content, using "html.parser" for parsing.
        4. Extracts the text content of the `<title>` tag and prints it to the console.

## Dependencies

* **External Libraries:**
    * `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests (version not specified - assumes latest).  Needed for fetching web pages.
    * `bs4` (BeautifulSoup): Used for parsing HTML content (version not specified – assumes latest). Needed for navigating and extracting data from the HTML structure.
* **Internal Dependencies:**
    * None. This script is self-contained.

## Edge Cases

* **Network Connectivity:** The script will fail if there's no internet connection or if the target server is unreachable.  Error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) could be added to gracefully handle these situations.
* **Website Changes:** The HTML structure of the target website can change, which would break the script. Robust scraping requires more sophisticated techniques like CSS selectors and error checking.
* **HTTP Status Codes:**  The script doesn't explicitly check for HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found). A non-200 response code indicates a problem that should be handled.
* **Rate Limiting/Blocking:** Google (and other sites) may block requests from this script if it's run too frequently.  Implementing delays or using proxies could mitigate this issue.

## Rationale

This implementation prioritizes simplicity and clarity over performance. Using `requests` is a standard approach for HTTP fetching, and BeautifulSoup provides a convenient way to parse HTML. Alternatives like `scrapy` offer more advanced features but would add complexity for this basic example.  The hardcoded URL allows for immediate execution without user input, making it easy to demonstrate the script's functionality.
